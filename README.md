# Simple File Manager

This is part of my Python practice and the first program I add to my portfolio.

A simple file manager where you insert your selected windows path into the command args.

The program generates a folder to the corresponding file type.

Currently supported:
* pdf
* doc
* docx
* jpeg
* png
* ppt
* pptx
* mp3
* mp4

To add file types, simply follow the scheme in the file_folder_correlation.
Keys: file ending / file type (e. g. ".pdf")
Value: Folder Name

## This project is open-source and everyone can use it.
